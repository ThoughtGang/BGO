				BGO UNIT TESTS

Any file beginning with 'ut_' is a unit test executed automatically by the
Rakefile, and must always pass.

Ruby scripts without the ut_ prefix are either obsolete/incomplete unit tests,
or helper scripts.

The following directories contain subsystem-specific unit tests:

	commands	- tests for the bin/bgo utility commands
	git		- tests for the Git-backed BGO data model
	integration	- tests of the integration of software components
	model		- tests for the BGO data model
	plugin_api	- tests for the BGO Plugin API
	plugins		- tests for specific plugins
	system		- end-to-end ('system') tests (platform-specific)

The following directories contain supporting scripts or data:

	repos	- temp directory where Git repos are created during unit testing
	shared	- ruby modules shared by multiple unit tests
	targets	- binary files used as targets by unit tests
	utils 	- misc ruby utilities used when writing tests
