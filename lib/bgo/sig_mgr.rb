# singleton class for managing signatures
#
# * signature path (like plugin path)
#
# Note: a signature plugin registers itself with the signature mgr. it
#       uses signature path to load all of its supported signature files.
#       the signature mgr then routes requests to generate.match sigs to
#       plugins.
